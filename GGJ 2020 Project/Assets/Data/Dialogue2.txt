Scromples: *lick*
Narrator: You receive perhaps the rudest awakening you've ever experienced.
You: Man... What a night... I think I passed out.
You: I don't think I've ever physically exerted myself so much in my life.
Scromples: *lick*
Narrator: The warm, wet tongue of a dog once again assaults your face.
You: Woah! Calm down there, I'm awake! I'm awake!
Narrator: A familiar face meets your eyes.
You: Scromples?
Scromples:  Arf! (Been a long time since I saw you!)
Scromples:  Boof! (Where did you go??? It's been forever!)
Narrator: You remember feeling like you forgot something when you moved to your new apartment three weeks ago... Oops.
You: Um... Just been really busy since then, buddy. (keybind 1) | So, I kind of forgot you were a thing... (keybind 2)
Scromples: Yip! (That's no excuse!) //OPTION 1
Scromples: *whines* (Whaaat? I'm the most important thing in the universe, though!) Bork! (You got a lot of things to work on!) //OPTION 2
Scromples:  Woof! (It has been at least...)
Scromples:  Grr! (Eight THOUSAND years since you got back!)
Scromples:  Bow! (I could have starved!)
Scromples:  Ruff! (And you're just sitting there!)
Scromples:  Arf! (I have not received...)
Scromples:  Bark! (A single pat!)
Narrator: It comes to your attention that this whole time, you haven't actually gotten up off the grass. You stand, and get a better look at the adorable mutt staring longingly up at you.
You: Pet the dog (keybind 1) | Pet the dog (keybind 2)
//NO OPTIONS
Narrator: In situations like these, it is physically impossible to not pet the dog.
Narrator: So you pet the dog.
Narrator: Scromples allows it, staring up at you begrudgingly.
Scromples:  Borf! (Yes!)
Scromples:  Woof! (That's better!)
Narrator: You realize that you need to make it up to Scromples if you want him back.
You: You wanna play fetch? (keybind 1) | You wanna go for a walk? (keybind 2)
Scromples: Yip! (Not gonna work, I have amazing willpower!)... Bark! (Okay, maybe it will work!) //OPTION 1
Scromples: Boof! (Yes! Walk is always correct answer!)
Narrator: After spending some quality time together, you and Scromples walk back to your apartment. He seems confused as to why you live in a new house, but is excited enough that you're here again.
Narrator: With your faithful pooch back at your side, you vow internally to be sure you remember to always bring him with you.
Narrator: Your heart feels a little less empty than before...
