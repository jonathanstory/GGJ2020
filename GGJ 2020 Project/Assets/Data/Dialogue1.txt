Narrator;By the force of sheer dumb luck, you find her during her shift at the local coffee shop. Gotta start the day with a massive load of caffeine, per usual.;0;L
Kylie;Oh...it's you.;4;L
You;Oh, hey...Kylie...Um...;2;L
You;(Kylie... what was her last name again?);2;L

Kylie;My last name is Aspen, you idiot. Geez, you don't even remember your former best friend's name? What is wrong with you?;4;L

Kylie;You never believed in my dreams of becoming a musician, and you've never cared about my goals in life. You didn't go to my first concert even when I held it in your backyard!;4;L
You;(I had a backyard?);2;L
Kylie;And now you show back up, thinking that'll fix anything?;4;L

Kylie;I guess I do appreciate the effort.;2;L
Kylie;Just don't expect me to start liking you again just because you want me to. Seriously, what's with that sudden change of heart?;2;L
Kylie;Why are you so interested in my life now?;2;L

Kylie;Look, it's cool that you're starting to be cool and all, but I've got a job to finish here.;0;L
Kylie;As your luck would have it, I'm going to be performing at a concert tonight. Show up to that, and we'll see.;0;L
Narrator;3 hours and $322 in ticket costs later...;0;L
Narrator;The concert was being held in a park near the center of town.;0;L
Narrator;You stood near the front, where Kylie could see you while she was up playing guitar.;0;L
Narrator;There's a long way to go before she forgives you, but hey, it's a start.;0;L
Narrator;Your heart feels a little less empty than before...;0;L
