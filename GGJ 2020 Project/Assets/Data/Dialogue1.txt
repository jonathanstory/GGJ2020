Narrator: By the force of sheer dumb luck, you find her during her shift at the local coffee shop. Gotta start the day with a massive load of caffeine, per usual.
Kylie: Oh...it's you.
You: Oh, hey...Kylie...Um...Uh...
You: (Kylie... what was her last name again?)
Kylie: It's Aspen, you idiot. Geez, you don't even remember your former best friend's name? What is wrong with you?
You: I'm sorry... (keybind 1) | You couldn't have picked an easier name? (keybind 2)
Kylie: After all of this, you're "sorry"? That's all you have to say for yourself? //OPTION 1
Kylie: Woooow. Really funny, hotshot. Makes sense you wouldn't take the time to even learn my name. //OPTION 2
Kylie: You never believed in my dreams of becoming a musician, and you've never cared about my goals in life. You didn't go to my first concert even when I held it in your backyard!
You: (I had a backyard?)
Kylie: And now you show back up, thinking that'll fix anything?
You: You're right. I've realized I've been a terrible friend to you and I'm here to make amends. (keybind 1) | Yup. (keybind 2)
Kylie: ... *sigh* //OPTION 1
Kylie: ... At least you're being honest with yourself. //OPTION 2
Kylie: I guess I do appreciate the effort.
Kylie: Just don't expect me to start liking you again just because you want me to. Seriously, what's with that sudden change of heart?
Kylie: Why are you so interested in my life now?
You: I just wanted to make things right, okay? (keybind 1) | In case you get famous. Call it hedging my bets. (keybind 2)
Kylie: You? Make things right? *laughs* //OPTION 1
Kylie: Never thought I'd hear the words. //OPTION 1, CTND
Kylie: *Laughs* Finally gonna acknowledge I have talent? //OPTION 2
Kylie: Guess that's a good start then. //OPTION 2, CTND
Kylie: Look, it's cool that you're starting to be cool and all, but I've got a job to finish here.
Kylie: As your luck would have it, I'm going to be performing at a concert tonight. Show up to that, and we'll see.
Narrator: 3 hours and $322 in ticket costs later...
Narrator: The concert was being held in a park near the center of town.
Narrator: You stood near the front, where Kylie could see you while she was up playing guitar.
Narrator: There's a long way to go before she forgives you, but hey, it's a start.
Narrator: Your heart feels a little less empty than before...
