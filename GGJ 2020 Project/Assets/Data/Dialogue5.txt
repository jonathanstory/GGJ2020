Dad: Oh Ho! Hello there!
You: Hi Dad! (Keybind 1) | This was a mistake... (Keybind 2)
Dad: So good to see you! //Option 1
Dad: Nonsense! Welcome to my studio! //Option 2

Dad: Why, I haven't seen you in such a long time.
Dad: Ever since you left to go to the store when you were nine, and never returned!
Dad: Say, did you ever get the milk you said you were going to buy?
You: I did. My bones are stronger for it. (Keybind 1) | Honestly, I just wanted to leave. (Keybind 2)
Dad: So they are! My oh my, aren't you just a chip off the old block! //Option 1
Dad: I can't possibly understand why you would! //Option 2

Dad: Now, my wonderful child. I'm truly glad that you've come back.
Dad: But you must know how much it hurt me that you left!!
Dad: Whysoever did you feel the need to leave?
You: It was an awful thing to do. I don't even really know anymore... (Keybind 1) | I decided that my lungs need more air than perfume. (Keybind 2)
Dad: Don't really know what, dear? There's really no use in remembering something if you've already forgot it, young offspring of mine! (Option 1)
Dad: Oh! Well, if I had known you didn't like that brand I'd have switched! It's really all about the fragrances! Really, I would have been happy to take you out sampling! (Option 2)

You: I don't think he really got the point of that, but that's fine.
Dad: Take a lesson from your old man...I'm glad you finally decided to join me in my endeavor of beauty!
Endeavor of what?
Dad: I know exactly why you're here! You came to take up the family business! Modeling is half genetics anyway!
Dad: Indeed, you've been fortunate enough to inherit my cheekbones!
Dad always did kind of believe that everyone wanted what he did...
You: How can I put this without hurting his feelings?
You: I don't think I'm quite ready for that yet... (Keybind 1) | Please no. God no. Good lord no. (Keybind 2)
Dad: Hmm. Don't you worry darling! We'll get you there! //Option 1
Dad: Hahaha! You've got such a lovely sense of humor! //Option 2

Dad: Now, the first step in getting you ready is a skincare routine!
Dad: How do you think I got my trademark shine?
Dad: Beauty isn't skin deep, but it is skin forwars, after all!
You: He's starting to snowball...I don't think there's any stopping him now...
Dad: Next we'll have to get you a steady diet and gym routine!
Dad: Fix some of...that...
You: Did he rally just gesture at me in general...? Ouch.
Narrator: You step back slightly. Dad doesn't appear to notice.

SPRITE DISSAPEARS HERE, KEEP BACKGROUND

Dad: Then there's wardrobe! Have to pick out a style that suits!
Narrator: You're almost to the door!
Dad: Then, accessories!
You: Sweet, sweet escape.

FADE TO BLACK

You'll come back later, once he's cooled off a bit...
The most important thing is that you got back into contact with him.
You're able to work towards making things right again.
The thought of that makes your heart feel full and satisfied.
There's a long road ahead for everyone, but you've taken the first steps to repair all the bonds you broke before.
